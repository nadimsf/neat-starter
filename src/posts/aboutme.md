I am a founder and product management leader with 20 years experience in cloud applications and platforms. I'm currently at Uber, where I've worked on simulation, visualization and ML platforms for autonomy software development for self-driving cars, as well as growth and ad tech. Prior to that I was the cofounder and CEO of BrightFunnel, a data, analytics and attribution platform for marketers. The company was acquired after scaling to $5M in ARR and 50 employees. Before that, I was VP at PowerReviews ($150M+ exit) and have held product roles at Salesforce, Amazon and McAfee and started my career as a consultant at Bain & Company. In addition to SaaS, the last 8 years of my work have focused on data and AI.

On the personal front, I live in San Francisco with my wife, two young kids and an old poodle. I was born a Bangladeshi national and spent my formative years in Switzerland, Japan and India. I moved to the US as a seventeen year-old to attend Cornell University, where I majored in economics and philosophy and had the opportunity to spend a year at Oxford as a visiting student at Lady Margaret Hall.
